/**
 * @name CodeGenius Learning Platform Security Rules
 * @author AI-Generated by an Expert Firebase Security Rules Architect
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset is designed for the CodeGenius learning platform. It enforces a
 * strict user-ownership model where all user-generated content is private and
 * can only be accessed by the user who created it.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is based on strict user data isolation. All data,
 * including learning paths, lessons, and performance records, is stored in
 * subcollections under that user's unique document in the `/users` collection.
 * This ensures that a user can only ever access their own data tree.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All application data is hierarchically organized under the path `/users/{userId}`.
 * This structure makes ownership clear and security rules simple and performant,
 * as authorization can be determined directly from the document path without
 * needing extra database reads.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Disabled: It is not possible to query the list of all
 *   users on the platform.
 * - Strict Ownership: All create, read, update, and delete operations are
 *   checked to ensure the requesting user is the owner of the data.
 * - Path-Based Security: Ownership is determined by the `{userId}` wildcard in
 *   the path, which must match the authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To ensure data integrity, certain documents (like LearningPath and
 * PerformanceRecord) contain a `userId` field. These rules validate on create that
 * this field matches the user from the document path, and enforce that it is
 * immutable on update. This prevents data from being accidentally associated
 * with the wrong user.
